# Tutorials

Below you can find several tutorials illustrating various features of the CoastDef package. Easch tutorial also discusses why the coad works, and what it means.

The tutuorials are done in Google Collab, a online, hoseted Jupyter notebook which allows you to colaborate with colleuges or partners. Jupyter notebooks allow you to mix text, mathematics, Python code, and outputs in a single, self-contained document. Each Collab tutorial notebook will open in a new virtual machine, and you will have to install the dependencies on it before running the more interesting code. This should take less than a minute.

The tutorials are read-only files, but you can download a copy to your Google Drive and edit them to your heart's content. (If you are interesting in contributing to the documentation, email ___ to get access.) All of this can be done in your browser, making it the easist and quickest way to explore CoastDef's functionality. We would encourage you to use Collab for your own small to medium-sized projects, as a local install is often more of a hassle.
