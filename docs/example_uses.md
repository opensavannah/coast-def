## A Proposed Seawall in Bridgeport, CT

This example proposal comes from Bridgeport's Seaside Village, an area that suffers from consistent flooding. We used the animate module to create video analyses of the area.

### Without Walls

This video shows how the area floods today as storm surge levels increase. The South End is an incredibly low-lying area, and it floods with storm surges as small as one foot.

### With Walls

This video illustrates how flooding patterns change after a defensive wall is built. The proposed walls are largely ineffective, as water quickly travels around the outside of them in this low-lying area. This analysis shows that the topography of Bridgeport will likely render piecemeal adaptation efforts futile; clearly a more robust protection strategy is needed.

## Climate Change Modeling

This video illustrates how uncertainty in climate change models can cause massive impacts down the road. It depicts how the flood extent of a small storm (with a storm surge of approximately one foot) will shift with climate change under different long-term modeling assumptions.
