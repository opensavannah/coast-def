The two began to work on this project with the goal of creating a tool that wholistically weighs the costs and benefits to society of constructing coastal walls and implementing resiliency strategies. The collaborative model is intended to expand in scope and functionality as a living tool. The code utilizes GitHub and GoogleColab to act as a living tool in the way that people can contribute new features easily to improve upon the functionality and relevance of the model for this desired analysis. This model seeks to fulfill a that currently exists in resilience engineering
