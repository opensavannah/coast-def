### An example of what we can do

To create the “Intermediate High” projection, the orange line in Figure 1, the CPO-1 report averaged the results of Vermeer and Rahmstorf (2009) and Grinsted et al. (2009). They then approximated the time evolution by a quadratic function

\[ E(t)=m\left(t-t_{0}\right)+b\left(t-t_{0}\right)^{2} \]

where \(t_{0}=1992\), \(m=1.7\ltimes10^{3}\),and \(b=8.71\ltimes10^{-5}\). Adapting this for Conneticut's subsistence rate to get produces 

\[ E(t)=\left(0.0007+m\right)\left(t-t_{0}\right)+b\left(t-t_{0}\right)^{2} \]

## Risk aversion

Here's a good [site](https://saylordotorg.github.io/text_introduction-to-economic-analysis/s14-04-risk-aversion.html).


Our risk aversion analysis draws heavily from the paper conducted by Attanasi and Karlinger “Risk Preferences and Flood Insurance”. In this paper, the authors discuss and conclude that when it comes to insuring for flood damages people are risk averse. Furthermore, they use the Von-Neumann Morgenstein expected-utility model to analyze the significance of the consumers’ choices.  The report 

The greatest challenge of quantifying risk aversion comes from the sometimes irrational behavior of individuals. In these two paper (Insert citation), the authors establish that individuals struggle to comprehend the damage that can be associated with very destructive infrequent storms. This irrational behavior leads to results that often do not match the hypothesis of the Von-Neumann Morgenstein expected-utility model. However, the goal of Coast-Def is to rationally assess the damages and weigh the potential benefit from investing significantly in infrastructure.
