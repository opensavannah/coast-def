## Sharing your models

If you have innovative models you've made, we would love to see them. If your code or notebook with us and the rest of the community, you will help support the scientific entprise. You will also help us introduce new features and add to our standard library of functions.

## Submitting feature requests and bug reports

We don't know what features would be valuable to other people until you ask for them. We also don't know what is confusing, broken, or incorrect without feedback. Just telling us these things by reporting an issue ca be a huge help. You can do that [here](https://github.com/zdb999/coast-def/issues).

## Contributing to the code base

The core functionality of is still under active development, so help is definitely wanted. However, things move quickly, so making a static list of tasks is not ideal. Instead, we would encourage you to check out the active [issues](https://github.com/zdb999/coast-def/issues).
